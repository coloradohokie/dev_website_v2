# Michael Newman's Development Website
Version 2

## About
This is the code for the website MichaelNewman.dev. I was encouraged to create a personal website at Flatiron school. In order to do this, I wanted to simulate a real world project that I might face as a developer, so I found a design online that I liked and without looking at the source code, I wanted to see if I could recreate it. I thought this would simulate being handed a design and asked to implement it.

This website is coded entirely in JavaScript ES6/React, SCSS, and HTML and is intended to showcase frontend capabilities. The following features are used in this website:

### React
* Router
* Module Based CSS/SCSS

### CSS
* Grid
* Flexbox
* Media queries
* Geometric shapes
* Image manipulation
* Mobile First Design
* Font and Text Manipulation

### SCSS
* Variables
* Nested Selectors

The original design that I based this website off of can be found here: https://bslthemes.com/ryan/demo/index-new-bg-image.html
