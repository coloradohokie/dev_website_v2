This is the code for the website MichaelNewman.dev. I was encouraged to create a personal website at Flatiron school. In order to do this, I wanted to simulate a real world project that I might face as a developer, so I found a design online that I liked and without looking at the source code, I wanted to see if I could recreate it. I thought this would simulate being handed a design and asked to implement it.

This website is coded entirely in Reactjs, SCSS, and HTML and is intended to showcase frontend capabilities. The following features are used in this website:

## React
* Router
* Module Based CSS/SCSS

## CSS
* Grid
* Flexbox
* Media queries
* Geometric shapes
* Image manipulation
* Mobile First Design
* Font and Text Manipulation

## SCSS
* Variables
* Nested Selectors

The original design that I based this website off of can be found here: https://bslthemes.com/ryan/demo/index-new-bg-image.html
